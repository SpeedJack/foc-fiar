\chapter{Application design}\label{ch:design}

The application is divided into three components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\standout{Common}] A library that contains modules that are used
		both by the server and the client. This includes the protocol
		implementation, networking functions, PEM serialization, error
		reporting, console output, \etc; Its code is available in the
		\code{common} folder;
	\item[\standout{Server}] The server application which handles the
		registered users allowing them to log-in and challenge each
		other. Its code is available in the \code{server} folder;
	\item[\standout{Client}] The client application that is used by the user
		to log-in with the server and play the game against other
		players. Its code is available in the \code{client} folder.
\end{itemize}

Each components is divided into a number of modules. Each module provides
functions for a specific functionality of the application and it's compound by a
\emph{C source file} and a \emph{Header file}. All header files are placed under
the \code{include} directory.

\figref{fig:modules} shows all the modules of the developed application along
with their connections with other modules\footnote{Only the main connections are
represented.}.
